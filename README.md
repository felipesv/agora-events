# Agora events

The world is in constant change and nothing has been the same since covid-19 and this has affected people’s economy. (economic instability)

We have decided to develop an application to help people and companies economy making events.
Taking into account that we can not gather physically our proposal is a website where people can share their events helping them during post covid-19 in the “new normality”, managing the audience attendance .
